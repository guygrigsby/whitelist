Hi. My name is Guy. I grew up in small town Colorado and have lived in Denver for almost 15 years.  I am white. I don't usually say that because I assume that _it_ is assumed. Which leads me to why we are here. I want to talk about my experiences with race. 

In conversations about racial injustice, white people don't talk about themselves or their experiences. That's appropriate. For example, it's pretty tone deaf to interject in a situation involving black people. It's impossible that a white person would be able to teach them about what they live everyday.

Among white people, on the other hand, I want to encourage us all to share what we have learned and feel about race and racism.  Is not talked about enough. 

 That's why I have built this site. I think that I have may gone through some of what white folks are going through right now. By sharing my experience, I hope to help normalize it. With some luck, it will be less uncomfortable for others.
