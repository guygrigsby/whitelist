I remember when I first heard the phrase "white privilege." It pissed me off. *I* was angry and *I* have privileges that many white people don't have. I thought, "I'm smart. I work hard and got to the position where I am now because I am awesome. I am a fucking software engineer." That's true. I _did_ work hard and I _am_ smart. Most of us work very hard and it really sucks when someone says something that sounds like we didn't earn what we have.

The problem with that phrase is that it puts many people on the defensive. Immediately. It did with me. I thought, 
> You don't know anything about me. Don't you judge me.
Fuck white privilege. I am just being a human and getting what I deserve. I thought that for a while. I wish I could pinpoint when I started to think about it differently. What I *do* know is that after doing some reading and talking to people, I came to see it differently. I'm a white dude in tech, which is pretty common. It's all very _normal_ to me. The way that I am treated is the normal way a person should be treated. Black people aren't treated the same way I am treated. When I chose to frame my privilege more like "black exclusion", it because easier for me to focus on others and not take it personally. 

I *do* deserve to be treated the way I am treated. So does every other human in this world. Black people in the United States are not treated like I am. They are treated as threats, as if undeserving of the same treatment. 

What's more is that none of us alive today designed or implemented the system the way it is now. Most of us have been unknowing participants. Once, we being to understand the way that black people are treated though, we are no longer able to claim ignorance. At that point, it's time to act. For white people, one of the greatest actions it to talk to other white people about race. To educate ourselves and share that knowledge.
We are considered "normal". As such, we are really the ones who have to demand change. Our voices are heard while theirs are not. We can use our influence to lift black people up. It doesn't really matter what you call it. The important part is that we recognize that white people and black people are treated very different.
